# Proposal: Implement Cyber-Space Glassmorphism UI

## Problem Statement
The current Web UI is functional but visually minimal. To provide a modern, professional, and immersive experience that aligns with the "Air" branding, a more sophisticated design is needed.

## Proposed Solution
Redesign the Web UI using a "Cyber/Space/Glassmorphism" aesthetic.
- **Visual Style**: Dark theme with high-contrast accents (Cyan, Green, Primary Blue), glassmorphism effects (blur, borders), and subtle glows.
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk for display text and Space Mono for technical details (file sizes, paths, timestamps).
- **Icons**: Transition to Material Symbols for consistent, high-quality iconography.
- **Responsiveness**: Use Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly layout.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Improve breadcrumbs and file listing with better visual hierarchy and hover effects.

## User Impact
- **Branding**: Establishes a unique and high-quality visual identity for the project.
- **Usability**: Improved clarity through better typography and layout.
- **Delight**: A more engaging and modern interface for file management.
